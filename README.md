# VA Loan Concierge

A multi-agent demo for a VA mortgage lender built on **Microsoft Foundry**. A single Veteran query routes across five specialized agents — each using a different Foundry capability — and synthesizes a unified response in real time.

**Foundry capabilities demonstrated:**
- **Foundry IQ** — grounded RAG across 11 knowledge sources (VA guidelines + live news) with inline citations
- **Custom MCP** — live tool invocation via an Azure Function App (refi calculator + appointment scheduler)
- **Work IQ Calendar** — Microsoft-hosted MCP creating real M365 calendar events
- **Workflow Agent** — declarative YAML orchestration for Copilot Studio / Teams
- **Content Understanding** — AI-structured VA mortgage news ingested from 11 live RSS feeds into the knowledge base
- **Human-in-the-Loop** — multi-turn conversations with calculator retry loops and appointment confirmation
- **Persistent Session State** — Cosmos DB preserves conversation state across server restarts
- **Newsletter Agent** — weekly VA mortgage market intelligence digest (5 sections, chat-rendered + weekly timer trigger)
- **Guardrails & Evaluations** — four-layer content safety, OpenAI Evals API, and OpenTelemetry observability

Two orchestration paths share the same agents:
- **React UI demo** — Python backend with real-time SSE streaming and an Agent Flow Log
- **Copilot Studio / Teams** — Foundry Workflow Agent (declarative YAML, no container needed)

## What It Does

A Veteran borrower interacts with a single chat interface. A single query like:

> *"I'm thinking about refinancing — am I eligible for an IRRRL, and can you show me what I'd save and schedule a call for Thursday?"*

…triggers a multi-agent pipeline that:

1. Answers VA loan eligibility questions with **cited, knowledge-base-grounded responses**
2. Collects loan details via a **human-in-the-loop prompt** (with retry loop and skip option)
3. Runs a **live refinance savings calculator** using real amortization math
4. **Books a consultation appointment** with a loan officer
5. Asks for **appointment confirmation** — confirm, reschedule, or decline
6. **Creates a calendar event** on the Veteran's M365 calendar via Work IQ
7. Streams every step of the reasoning — agent activations, tool calls, source citations — to a real-time Agent Flow Log in the UI

| Workflow | `va-loan-concierge-workflow` | Foundry Workflow Agent | Declarative orchestration for Copilot Studio / Teams (routes to all sub-agents, v13) |

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) (`az`)
- [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd) (`azd`)
- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 18+
- An Azure subscription with permissions to create resources
- An M365 Copilot license (only needed for the Calendar Agent's Work IQ Calendar integration)

### Provision Infrastructure (`azd up`)

The entire Azure infrastructure is defined as code. A single command provisions everything, deploys the MCP server, and registers all Foundry agents.

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the repo
git clone https://github.com/<org>/va-loan-concierge.git
cd va-loan-concierge

# 2. Authenticate with Azure
az login
azd auth login

# 3. Provision + deploy everything
azd up
```

`azd up` will prompt you for:
- **Environment name** — e.g. `valc-demo-abc123` (becomes the suffix for all resource names)
- **Azure subscription** — select from your available subscriptions
- **Azure region** — select from the curated list (eastus, eastus2, westus, westus3, swedencentral)

This creates the following Azure resources:

| Resource | Name | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Resource Group | `rg-{env}` | Container for all resources |
| AI Services | `ais-{env}` | Foundry + OpenAI models + connections (next-gen Foundry resource) |
| AI Project | `proj-{env}` | Foundry project (all agents registered here) |
| AI Search | `srch-{env}` | Vector search backend for Foundry IQ Knowledge Base |
| Function App | `func-{env}` | Custom MCP server — Flex Consumption (FC1) |
| Storage Account | `st{env}` | Blob storage for KB docs + news articles + Function App runtime |
| Cosmos DB | `cosmos-{env}` | Persistent HIL conversation state (Serverless NoSQL) |
| App Insights | `appi-{env}` | Application-level observability (OpenTelemetry traces) |
| Log Analytics | `log-{env}` | Required by App Insights |

**Blob containers** inside the Storage Account:

| Container | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `loan-guidelines` | Static VA loan knowledge docs (`va_guidelines.md`, `lender_products.md`, `loan_process_faq.md`) — Foundry IQ KB source 1 |
| `news-articles` | CU-ingested VA mortgage news markdown files — Foundry IQ KB source 2 (Phase 14) |
| `deploymentpackage` | Flex Consumption Function App deployment packages (runtime) |

**RBAC role assignments** (15 total — all automated by `infra/modules/rbac.bicep`):

| Principal | Role | Resource | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI Services MI | Search Index Data Reader | AI Search | KB queries via MCP |
| AI Services MI | Search Index Data Contributor | AI Search | KB indexing and embedding updates |
| Project MI | Search Index Data Reader | AI Search | KB queries via agent MCPTool |
| Project MI | Search Index Data Contributor | AI Search | KB indexing |
| Project MI | Cognitive Services OpenAI User | AI Services | Responses API calls for all agents |
| Project MI | Cognitive Services User | AI Services | Agent management (data plane) |
| Search MI | Cognitive Services OpenAI User | AI Services | Generates embeddings during KB indexing |
| Search MI | Storage Blob Data Reader | Storage | Indexer reads docs from blob containers |
| Current User | Cognitive Services OpenAI User | AI Services | Local dev (`az login` credential) |
| Current User | Cognitive Services User | AI Services | Agent registration via `az login` |
| Current User | Search Index Data Contributor | AI Search | `postprovision.ps1` creates KB index |
| Current User | Storage Blob Data Contributor | Storage | `postprovision.ps1` uploads knowledge docs |
| Current User | Contributor | Resource Group | ARM PUT for RemoteTool project connections |
| Function App MI | Storage Blob Data Owner | Storage | Function App runtime (blob + queue access) |
| Function App MI | Storage Queue Data Contributor | Storage | Functions runtime uses internal queues |
| Function App MI | Cognitive Services User | AI Services | Content Understanding analyzer CRUD |
| Function App MI | Cognitive Services OpenAI User | AI Services | CU analysis calls + model access |
| Function App MI | Storage Blob Data Contributor | Storage | Writes news markdown to `news-articles` |

> Cosmos DB RBAC uses a separate data-plane role system (`Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlRoleAssignments`) with the built-in **Cosmos DB Data Contributor** role — not standard Azure RBAC.

After provisioning completes, `azd up` automatically:
1. Uploads the 3 knowledge documents to the `loan-guidelines` blob container
2. Creates an AI Search data source, index, skillset, and indexer (`loan-guidelines` blob → embeddings → vector index)
3. Provisions RemoteTool connections for the KB MCP and custom MCP endpoints
4. Deploys the MCP server to the Function App via `func azure functionapp publish`
5. Syncs `tools/content_ingestion.py` → `mcp-server/tools/` before publishing (keeps the pipeline in sync)
6. Writes `.env` from azd environment values
7. Registers all 6 Foundry agents and uploads the workflow definition

> **Updating knowledge sources:** To add or update documents, upload new files to the `loan-guidelines` blob container and re-run the Search indexer. No redeployment needed.

### Manual Step 1: Create Foundry IQ Knowledge Base

The Advisor Agent requires a Foundry IQ Knowledge Base backed by the blob storage containers that `azd up` populates. This must be created manually in the Foundry portal because the SDK for programmatic KB creation is in preview and unreliable.

1. Open the [Microsoft Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com) → your project (`proj-{env}`)
2. Go to **Knowledge** (left sidebar) → **+ New knowledge base**
3. Fill in the knowledge base details:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name** | `kb-va-loan-concierge` |
| **Description** | `VA Loan Concierge knowledge base for the Advisor Agent. Covers VA loan eligibility, COE requirements, IRRRL qualification, funding fee tables, entitlement calculations, minimum property requirements, appraisal and Tidewater, closing costs, jumbo and renovation loans, state overlays, lender products, borrower FAQ, and live VA mortgage news ingested every 4 hours from 11 RSS feeds.` |

4. Under **Knowledge sources**, click **+ Add source** → **Azure Blob Storage** (static loan guidelines):

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name** | `ks-loan-guidelines` |
| **Storage account** | `st{env}` |
| **Container** | `loan-guidelines` |
| **Source description** | `Static VA loan knowledge: eligibility guidelines and COE requirements, lender products (IRRRL, Cash-Out Refi, VA Jumbo, VA Renovation), borrower FAQ, complete 2024/2025 funding fee tables and exemptions, entitlement calculations (basic/bonus/residual), minimum property requirements, appraisal and Tidewater Initiative, allowable closing costs and fees, jumbo and renovation loans, and state-specific lender overlays.` |

5. Under **Retrieval settings**:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Output mode** | `Extractive data` |
| **Reasoning effort** | `Low` |
| **Retrieval instructions** | `You are answering questions from Veterans and loan officers about VA home loans. Always search all knowledge sources to find relevant information. For eligibility and entitlement questions, check va_guidelines.md and va_entitlement_calculations.md. For funding fee questions, check va_funding_fee_tables.md. For property condition and appraisal questions, check va_minimum_property_requirements.md and va_appraisal_and_tidewater.md. For COE and documentation questions, check va_coe_and_eligibility_documentation.md. For closing cost questions, check va_closing_costs_and_allowable_fees.md. For jumbo or renovation loans, check va_jumbo_and_renovation_loans.md. For lender overlays and state rules, check va_state_overlays_and_lender_guidelines.md. For current rates and recent policy changes, check the news articles source and include the publication date. Synthesize across sources when relevant. Always cite which source supports each claim.` |
| **Answer instructions** | `Provide clear, accurate answers grounded in the knowledge sources. Use a professional but approachable tone appropriate for Veterans. Structure longer answers with bullet points or numbered lists. When citing sources, reference the document name (e.g., va_funding_fee_tables.md) or news source with date (e.g., Freddie Mac PMMS — 2026-03-28). If information is not found in the knowledge base, say so clearly — do not speculate or invent facts. For calculations or scheduling requests, note that those are handled by separate specialist agents.` |

6. Under **Model configuration**:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Embedding model** | `text-embedding-3-small` |
| **Chat model** | `gpt-4.1` |

7. Click **Create**

After creation, verify the KB name in your `.env` matches:
```
ADVISOR_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_NAME=kb-va-loan-concierge
```

### Manual Step 2: Add News Articles as Second Knowledge Source (Phase 14)

After `azd up`, the news ingestion pipeline is running and the `news-articles` blob container has been created. To make the Advisor Agent aware of live VA mortgage news, add this container as a second knowledge source in the same Knowledge Base.

1. Open the [Microsoft Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com) → your project → **Knowledge**
2. Select your knowledge base (`kb-va-loan-concierge`)
3. Under **Knowledge sources**, click **+ Add source** → **Azure Blob Storage**:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name** | `ks-va-loan-news-articles` |
| **Storage account** | `st{env}` |
| **Container** | `news-articles` |
| **Source description** | `Live VA mortgage news — VA policy updates, CFPB regulatory changes, weekly rate surveys (Freddie Mac PMMS), and industry news. Ingested every 4 hours as structured markdown files. Always cite the source name and publish date when referencing this source.` |

4. Click **Save**

After this step, the Advisor Agent will automatically query both the static loan guidelines and the live news articles when answering questions. Foundry IQ handles vectorization of new blobs automatically — no manual index management needed.

> **Triggering a manual ingest:** To populate the news index immediately (without waiting for the 4-hour timer), call the manual trigger:
> ```bash
> curl -X POST https://func-{env}.azurewebsites.net/ingest
> ```

### Manual Step 3: Configure Work IQ Calendar (Optional)

The Calendar Agent requires a Work IQ Calendar connection for M365 calendar integration. This needs an M365 Copilot license and must be configured in the Foundry portal.

1. Open the Foundry portal → your project → **Connections**
2. Click **+ New connection** → **Work IQ Calendar**
3. Follow the OAuth consent flow to authorize calendar access
4. Copy the MCP endpoint URL and connection name, then set them:

```bash
azd env set SCHEDULER_CALENDAR_ENDPOINT <endpoint-url>
azd env set SCHEDULER_CALENDAR_CONNECTION <connection-name>
azd hooks run postprovision    # re-writes .env and re-registers agents with calendar connection
```

### Manual Step 4: Assign Guardrails to Agents (Recommended)

`azd up` creates two guardrail policies (`va-loan-advisor-guardrail` and `va-loan-tools-guardrail`) but they must be assigned to agents in the portal:

1. Open the Foundry portal → your project → **Build > Agents**
2. Select `va-loan-advisor-iq` → **Guardrails** → **Manage** → assign `va-loan-advisor-guardrail`
3. Repeat for `va-loan-calculator-mcp` and `va-loan-scheduler-mcp` → assign `va-loan-tools-guardrail`

This enables per-agent content safety controls including jailbreak detection, PII detection, and tool call scanning.

> **Note:** The demo works without the manual steps partially configured — the Advisor Agent needs the KB to answer questions, but the Calculator and Scheduler agents function independently. The Calendar Agent step is skipped if the Work IQ Calendar connection is not configured. Guardrails add safety controls but agents function without them.

### Run the Demo

After `azd up`, run the demo locally:

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Terminal 1 — start the FastAPI backend
uvicorn api.server:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2 — start the React UI
cd ui
npm install        # first time only
npm run dev
# → Open http://localhost:5173
```

Select a borrower profile (Marcus, Sarah, or James) and click a demo query button to see the full agent pipeline in action.

### Troubleshooting: Storage Account and Cosmos DB Network Access

Azure subscriptions with strict policy enforcement (managed sandboxes, corporate tenants) may automatically disable public network access on Storage Accounts and Cosmos DB accounts overnight or after certain policy compliance cycles. If `azd up` succeeds but the demo fails the next day with blob upload errors, Knowledge Base indexer failures, or Cosmos DB connection errors, verify that public access is still enabled:

1. **Storage Account** (`st{env}` in the Azure portal):
   - Navigate to **Security + networking** → **Networking**
   - Confirm **Public network access** is set to **Enabled from all networks**
   - If it was disabled by policy, re-enable it and re-run:
     ```bash
     azd hooks run postprovision   # re-uploads KB docs and re-runs indexer
     ```

2. **Cosmos DB** (`cosmos{env}` in the Azure portal):
   - Navigate to **Settings** → **Networking**
   - Confirm **Public network access** is set to **All networks**
   - If disabled, re-enable it and restart the backend (`uvicorn api.server:app --reload --port 8000`)

> **Note for Phase 12 (Network Isolation):** When network isolation is implemented, both resources will use private endpoints instead of public access. For now, public access is required for the demo to function.

### Troubleshooting: Cosmos DB Region Capacity

If `azd up` fails with a Cosmos DB `ServiceUnavailable` error mentioning "high demand for zonal redundant accounts," the selected region has hit availability zone capacity limits. Deploy Cosmos DB to a different region while keeping everything else in your primary region:

```bash
azd env set COSMOS_LOCATION eastus2    # or any region with Cosmos capacity
azd up
```

Cosmos DB is a globally distributed service — the region doesn't need to match the rest of the stack. When `COSMOS_LOCATION` is not set, Cosmos deploys to the same region as all other resources (the default and expected behavior).

### Tear Down

```bash
azd down
```

This deletes the resource group and all resources within it. Clean, no orphans.

---

## Alternative: CLI-Only Mode

Run the flagship query end-to-end in the terminal without the UI:

```bash
az login
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Default flagship IRRRL scenario
python main.py

# Custom query
python main.py --query "Can I use my VA loan benefit a second time?"
```

---

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/     # 111 tests — all agents mocked, no Azure calls needed
```

---

## Running Evaluations

Agent evaluations run server-side via the OpenAI Evals API. Queries are sent directly to your registered Foundry agents, evaluated by builtin evaluators, and results appear in the Foundry portal under **Build > Evaluations**.

```bash
az login
python evals/run_eval.py                       # advisor eval (task adherence, groundedness, coherence, relevance)
python evals/run_eval.py --agent orchestrator  # orchestrator eval (task adherence, coherence)
python evals/run_eval.py --all                 # both
python evals/run_eval.py --cleanup             # delete old evals + files
```

The script polls for completion and prints a portal URL linking directly to the results.

## Key Features

### Foundry IQ — Grounded Knowledge Base (Advisor Agent)

The Advisor Agent connects to an **Azure AI Search Knowledge Base** via MCP with `ProjectManagedIdentity` auth — no API keys.

**Knowledge sources (3 documents):**
- `va_guidelines.md` — VA eligibility rules, COE requirements, IRRRL rules, funding fee tables
- `lender_products.md` — Lender loan products, IRRRL, Cash-Out Refi, VA Jumbo, overlays
- `loan_process_faq.md` — Borrower FAQ, process steps, myths, edge cases

Every factual claim includes a **citation marker** (`【idx†source】`) resolved to a filename and streamed to the UI as a source chip.

### Custom MCP Server — Live Tool Invocation (Calculator + Scheduler)

An **Azure Function App** (`mcp-server/`) implements the MCP JSON-RPC protocol over HTTP. No `mcp` Python package required.

**`refi_savings_calculator`** — Real amortization math:
- Monthly payment delta, annual savings, break-even timeline, lifetime savings net of closing costs
- Applies VA IRRRL closing cost structure ($4,050 base + 0.5% funding fee, waived if disability-exempt)
- Reports whether the **VA net tangible benefit test** passes (break-even ≤ 36 months)

**`appointment_scheduler`** — Books a consultation slot:
- Normalizes fuzzy inputs ("morning", "afternoon", "thurs")
- Returns confirmed slot with loan officer name, calendar date, and confirmation number
- Appointment type is context-aware: "IRRRL review and rate lock" vs. "VA Loan Consultation"

### Human-in-the-Loop — Multi-Turn Conversations

The orchestrator supports **multi-turn conversations** where it pauses to collect user input before proceeding. Session state is persisted in **Cosmos DB** (production) or an in-memory fallback (local dev/tests), with a 10-minute TTL. State survives server restarts in production.

**Calculator HIL — Loan Details Collection:**
When no borrower profile is loaded and the calculator is needed, the orchestrator pauses with a 5-field prompt (balance, current rate, new rate, remaining term, fee exemption). If the calculator can't run with the provided details, it retries up to 3 times — or the user can say "skip" to move on.

**Appointment Confirmation HIL:**
After the Scheduler books an appointment, the orchestrator pauses for confirmation. The user can:
- **Confirm** — Calendar Agent creates an M365 calendar event
- **Reschedule** — Scheduler re-runs with the new preference, then asks again
- **Decline** — Calendar step skipped, appointment still confirmed
- **Unrecognized input** — moves on gracefully without creating a calendar event

Both HIL patterns work in the Python orchestrator (React UI) and the Foundry Workflow Agent (Copilot Studio / Teams), using `GotoAction` loops and `ConditionGroup` branching in the declarative YAML. All HIL pause points include graceful fallbacks for unrecognized input.

### Memory Architecture — Two Layers

The system is designed around **two distinct memory layers** that serve different purposes:

| Layer | Technology | Purpose | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Session State** | Cosmos DB (Phase 13) | Track orchestration flow within a conversation | Single session, 10-min TTL |
| **Long-Term Memory** | Foundry Memory Stores (Phase 16 — planned) | Remember Veterans across conversations | Cross-session, persistent |

**Session state** is structured and deterministic — routing flags, retry counts, pending actions, accumulated agent results. The Python orchestrator writes state at 11 mutation points; the Workflow Agent uses built-in workflow runtime variables. Both paths maintain behavioral parity.

**Long-term memory** (planned) will use Foundry Memory Stores — a preview feature where the LLM automatically extracts and recalls semantic facts across conversations. Example: after Marcus refinances via IRRRL, the system remembers his rate, fee exemption status, and scheduling preferences. When he returns weeks later for a cash-out question, his context is already loaded — no re-collection needed. Memory Stores are per-agent and shared across both orchestration paths (React UI and Teams).

### Content Understanding — VA Mortgage News Pipeline (Phase 14)

An Azure Content Understanding (CU) pipeline ingests live VA mortgage news from RSS feeds every 4 hours, uses `gpt-4.1` to extract structured fields from each article, and writes the results as formatted markdown files to blob storage. Foundry IQ automatically vectorizes and indexes the blobs, making the Advisor Agent's answers continuously up to date with the latest VA mortgage news.

**How it works:**
1. An **Azure Functions timer trigger** (`ingest_timer`) runs every 4 hours
2. `feedparser` fetches articles from 11 configured RSS feeds (VA Home Loans, CFPB, Freddie Mac PMMS, Mortgage News Daily, HousingWire, National Mortgage News, MBA, Census Bureau Housing, NY Fed, Calculated Risk)
3. Each article is submitted to a **custom CU analyzer** (`vaMortgageNews`) that uses `gpt-4.1` to extract 7 structured fields:
   - `Title`, `PublishDate` (extracted), `SourceType` (classified into 5 categories)
   - `Summary`, `RateInfo`, `PolicyUpdate`, `RelevanceToVeterans` (generated)
4. Structured fields are rendered into a **human-readable markdown file** and written to the `news-articles` blob container
5. **Foundry IQ automatically picks up new blobs**, chunks them, generates embeddings, and makes them queryable — no manual index management
6. The Advisor Agent queries both the static loan guidelines and the live news articles in a single KB lookup

**Why Content Understanding instead of Bing/Web Search?**

A Bing or web search grounding tool would surface any webpage matching the query — including low-quality sources, competitor marketing, or outdated content. For a regulated financial services use case, that's a compliance and accuracy risk. Content Understanding gives us full control:

| | Content Understanding (this approach) | Bing / Web Search |
|---|---|---|
| **Sources** | Hand-selected authoritative feeds (VA.gov, CFPB, Freddie Mac, MBA) | Any webpage on the internet |
| **Content quality** | Pre-processed and validated by gpt-4.1 before indexing | Raw web content, variable quality |
| **Structure** | Normalized fields (summary, rate info, policy change, veteran relevance) | Unstructured HTML |
| **Compliance** | Auditable — every ingested article is a versioned blob | No audit trail |
| **Citation accuracy** | Articles cite exact source name and publish date | URL-only citation, may be stale |
| **Deduplication** | SHA-256 of URL — never re-analyzes the same article | No deduplication |
| **Cost** | CU + gpt-4.1 per article, amortized over 4h batches | Per-query search cost |
| **Latency** | Zero — content already indexed when user asks | Adds real-time search round-trip to every query |

CU also demonstrates a Foundry-native capability (GA tool, same resource as the model deployments) rather than a generic web search that any application can add.

**CU model requirements:** Three deployed models are required — `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, and `text-embedding-3-large`. All three are deployed by `azd up` via `ai-services.bicep`.

**Manual trigger for testing:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://func-{env}.azurewebsites.net/ingest
# Returns: {"fetched": N, "analyzed": N, "indexed": N, "skipped": N, "errors": N}
```

**Deduplication:** SHA-256 of the article URL determines the blob filename. If the blob already exists, the article is skipped before CU analysis — second and subsequent runs complete in seconds.

**Code layout:**
- `tools/content_ingestion.py` — `NewsIngestionPipeline` class (source of truth)
- `tools/feed_sources.json` — RSS feed configurations
- `mcp-server/ingest_trigger.py` — Azure Function timer + HTTP triggers
- `mcp-server/tools/` — copy of the above, synced by `postprovision.ps1` before deploy

> **Keeping `mcp-server/tools/` in sync:** The Function App cannot import from parent directories, so `tools/content_ingestion.py` is copied to `mcp-server/tools/` automatically by `postprovision.ps1` before each Function App publish. Never edit `mcp-server/tools/` directly — edit `tools/content_ingestion.py` at the repo root instead. Running `azd up` keeps everything synchronized.

### Newsletter Agent — VA Mortgage Market Intelligence Digest (Phase 15)

The Newsletter Agent generates a structured weekly digest of VA mortgage news organized into five sections, drawing from both the static knowledge base (11 VA topic files) and the live news articles ingested by the Phase 14 CU pipeline.

**Five digest sections:**
1. **Market Trends** — rate movements, housing data, Fed activity
2. **Regulatory & Policy** — CFPB actions, VA circulars, compliance changes
3. **Competitor & Industry Moves** — lender news, M&A, originator moves
4. **Client & Partner News** — MBA, trade associations, service provider updates
5. **Industry Events** — conferences, advocacy calendar

Each item uses the format: `- **[Title]** — summary. *Why it matters:* leadership implication. *(Source: name, date)*`

**Triggering the digest:**
```bash
# On-demand via HTTP (deployed Function App):
curl -X POST https://func-{env}.azurewebsites.net/newsletter
# Returns: {"agent": "newsletter", "digest": "# VA Mortgage Market Intelligence...", "timestamp": "..."}

# Chat UI:
# Ask: "Send me the weekly VA mortgage market intelligence digest."
# → newsletter_start → newsletter_tool_call → newsletter_complete events stream in Agent Flow Log
```

**Automatic weekly digest:** A timer trigger (`newsletter_timer`) runs every Monday at 09:00 UTC and logs the generated digest. Phase 15b will add email delivery via ACS.

**Architecture note:** The Function App's `newsletter_trigger.py` calls `resolve_version()` instead of `initialize()` — it looks up the latest existing Foundry agent version rather than creating a new one. The Python backend (`api/server.py`) is the sole owner of agent registration. If the backend has never been started, the Function App will raise a clear error rather than silently creating a divergent agent version.

### Work IQ Calendar — M365 Integration (Calendar Agent)

After the Scheduler confirms an appointment and the user confirms, the Calendar Agent calls `CreateEvent` on the **Work IQ Calendar MCP server** to place it on the Veteran's M365 calendar.

### Demo Borrower Profiles

Three selectable profiles inject personalized context into every agent query:

| Profile | Background | Demo Scenario |
|---|---|---|
| **Marcus T.** | Army Veteran, 10% disability, existing VA loan at 6.8% | IRRRL flagship — fee exempt, full savings calc + booking |
| **Sarah K.** | Navy Veteran, first-time buyer, no existing loan | Purchase eligibility — blocked from IRRRL, gets "VA Loan Consultation" |
| **Lt. James R.** | Active duty, OCONUS deployed, second VA loan use | Second-use eligibility + refi on higher balance |

## Teams / M365 Copilot Publishing

The workflow agent can be published to Microsoft Teams and M365 Copilot from the Foundry portal.

### Prerequisites

- **Microsoft 365 Copilot license** (full, not Basic) — required for custom agents in M365 Copilot. Copilot Chat (Basic) shows the agent but returns a generic error when invoked.
- **Same Entra tenant** — the Foundry project, M365 Copilot license, and Teams users must all be in the same Entra tenant. Cross-tenant access requires guest user invitations and RBAC, which may be blocked by tenant policies.
- **Azure AI User role** — users accessing the agent through Teams must have the `Azure AI User` built-in role on the AI Services account/project.

### Publishing Steps

1. In the Foundry portal, navigate to **Build → Agents → va-loan-concierge-workflow**
2. Click **Publish** → **Publish to Teams and M365 Copilot**
3. Fill in the required fields (name, description, icons) and select **Individual** scope
4. The portal auto-creates a Bot Service resource and Entra ServiceIdentity
5. After publishing, the agent appears in M365 Copilot (requires full license)
6. To install in Teams directly, download the **manifest zip** from the publish screen and sideload it via Teams → Apps → Manage your apps → Upload a custom app

### Known Limitations

- **Duplicate responses in Bot Web Chat** — each bot response appears twice. This is a platform-level issue with the activity protocol, not the workflow YAML (Foundry playground shows single responses).
- **ServiceIdentity type** — the auto-created Bot Service identity cannot be changed to MultiTenant and does not support client secret generation for OAuth configuration.
- **Embedding deployment stability** — the `text-embedding-3-small` deployment can enter a broken state where it returns `OperationNotSupported`. Fix by deleting and recreating the deployment via CLI:
  ```bash
  az cognitiveservices account deployment delete --name <ai-services-name> --resource-group <rg-name> --deployment-name text-embedding-3-small
  az cognitiveservices account deployment create --name <ai-services-name> --resource-group <rg-name> --deployment-name text-embedding-3-small --model-name text-embedding-3-small --model-version 1 --model-format OpenAI --sku-name Standard --sku-capacity 30
  ```
- **Cross-tenant not supported** — if the Foundry project and M365 tenant are different, the Foundry OAuth flow returns 500 errors. Deploy everything in the same tenant.

### Bot Web Chat (Alternative Demo Channel)

If M365 Copilot is unavailable, the Bot Service "Test in Web Chat" in the Azure portal provides a working external channel. Navigate to the Bot Service resource → Test in Web Chat.
